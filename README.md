##Disclamer
This version for now does work but has mostly glitches and unifinished parts. The last stable version is up there have
fun using it if you want to change the ip or port, simply add a ip.cfg file in the same folder for the ip and a port.cfg file. !
warning it has to be a .cfg file not .cfg.txt or whatever.
